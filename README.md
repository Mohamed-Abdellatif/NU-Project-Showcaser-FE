## 🛡️ Type Safety

The project uses TypeScript for type safety. The configuration is split into:
- `tsconfig.json` - Base TypeScript configuration
- `tsconfig.app.json` - Application-specific configuration
- `tsconfig.node.json` - Node.js environment configuration

## 📝 ESLint Configuration

The project includes a comprehensive ESLint setup for code quality. The configuration includes:
- Type-aware lint rules
- React-specific linting
- Strict TypeScript checks

To enable additional type-aware lint rules, update the ESLint configuration as shown in the [ESLint Configuration Guide](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/).

## 🔄 Version Control

The project uses Git for version control. Make sure to:
1. Create feature branches for new features
2. Write meaningful commit messages
3. Follow the project's branching strategy

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
